### About
-------------
This is my second project made in Godot v3.5.1. It's a clone of the popular Arkanoid game. It was made using C# and it features 10 different levels and the ability to create your own ones. <br> 
It also features multiple powerups for the player to collect after destroying bricks. There are 3 types of bricks in the game, each behaving a little differently. <br>

#### WARNING !
Being my second C# game and me being more and more accustomed to Godot back then, the code wasn't that bad. Of course, it's not gonna be great, but I can definitely see improvement after Platformer. <br>
I did some small clean up and added comments but I haven't made any significant changes to the code. <br>
I uploaded this repo and preserved the game for me to look at how much I improve over time. Improving the code now, with my current knowledge defeats the point. <br>
However, you're free to improve upon this code if you wish to do so :)

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot Mono v3.5.1. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.
